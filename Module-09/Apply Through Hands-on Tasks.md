## Introduction

In this hands-on task, you will explore cloud environments and practice basic cloud security activities.

The goal is to understand how cloud resources work, investigate security incidents, review logs, and identify possible security weaknesses.

The main objective is to **explore, analyze, identify, and report cloud security issues through practical tasks.**

---

## Project Goal

You will perform basic cloud security activities to understand how cloud environments are monitored and protected.

You will practice:

* Exploring cloud resources
* Analyzing cloud security incidents
* Reviewing cloud logs
* Identifying cloud misconfigurations
* Creating a cloud security assessment report

### Technologies and Tools

* AWS Management Console
* AWS IAM
* AWS CloudTrail
* AWS security monitoring tools
* AI tools for security analysis, when useful

You can use an AWS Free Tier account or a permitted lab environment. Some services may incur charges, so check pricing before creating resources.

# 1. Explore Cloud Environments

First, explore a cloud environment to understand its resources and security settings.

For this task, use the AWS Management Console or an authorized cloud lab.

### Step 1: Explore the Cloud Console

Sign in to your authorized cloud environment.

Explore the available services and understand their purposes.

### Step 2: Review Cloud Resources

Look at resources such as:

* **IAM:** Manages users, roles, and permissions.
* **EC2:** Provides virtual servers.
* **S3:** Stores files and objects.
* **VPC:** Provides a logically isolated network.
* **CloudTrail:** Records AWS account activity.

Only inspect resources you own or have permission to access.

### Step 3: Understand Resource Security

Check the security settings of available resources.

Ask yourself:

* Who can access these resources?
* What permissions do users have?
* Is any resource publicly accessible?
* Are security settings configured appropriately?

### Record Your Observations

Write down the resources you explored and their security purposes.

# 2. Analyze Cloud Security Incidents

Now learn how to investigate possible security incidents in a cloud environment.

Use sample incident data, a training lab, or authorized cloud logs.

### Step 1: Understand Common Incidents

Examples of cloud security incidents include:

* Unauthorized login attempts
* Suspicious API activity
* Compromised credentials
* Unexpected changes to permissions
* Unusual access to stored data

### Step 2: Investigate an Incident

Choose a sample incident and examine the available evidence.

Look for:

* What activity occurred?
* When did it happen?
* Which user or identity was involved?
* Which resource was affected?
* Was the activity expected or suspicious?

### Step 3: Determine Possible Causes

Use the available evidence to identify possible causes.

For example, unexpected permission changes might indicate a configuration mistake or unauthorized activity.

Do not assume an incident is malicious without sufficient evidence.

### Record Your Findings

Document the incident, the evidence you found, its possible cause, and the actions that should be taken.

---

# 3. Review Cloud Logs

Cloud logs help you understand what is happening inside a cloud environment.

### Step 1: Access CloudTrail

In AWS, open CloudTrail and review available event history in an authorized account.

CloudTrail records many account activities and API events.

### Step 2: Examine Events

Review details such as:

* Event name
* Event time
* User identity
* Event source
* Affected resource
* Event result or error details, when available

### Step 3: Identify Suspicious Activity

Look for unusual events, such as:

* Repeated failed API requests
* Unexpected IAM policy changes
* Unusual resource creation
* Changes to security settings
* Activity from an unexpected identity

A single unusual event does not automatically mean an attack occurred. Investigate the surrounding evidence.

### Step 4: Record Important Events

Create a short summary of the events you reviewed and explain which ones require further investigation.

---

# 4. Identify Cloud Misconfigurations

A cloud misconfiguration occurs when a cloud resource has an incorrect or insecure setting.

### Step 1: Review IAM Permissions

Check whether users and roles have more permissions than they need.

Ask:

* Does the user have unnecessary administrator access?
* Are permissions limited to required resources?
* Are access policies appropriate for the user's role?

### Step 2: Check Storage Access

Review the access settings of available storage resources, such as S3 buckets.

Ask:

* Is public access necessary?
* Could unauthorized users access sensitive data?
* Are the bucket permissions configured appropriately?

### Step 3: Review Network Security

Inspect available network security settings.

Look for:

* Unnecessarily open inbound ports
* Overly broad access rules
* Public exposure of resources that should be private
* Missing network restrictions

### Step 4: Document Security Weaknesses

Record each potential misconfiguration.

Example:

```text
1. Excessive IAM permissions
2. Unnecessary public storage access
3. Overly permissive network rules
4. Missing or insufficient monitoring
```

These are examples to investigate, not findings that should be assumed to exist in every cloud environment.

Only make changes in environments where you have authorization.

---

# 5. Create a Cloud Security Assessment Report

Finally, prepare a report describing your cloud security assessment.

The report should summarize what you explored, what you investigated, and what you found.

### Step 1: Environment Overview

Mention:

* Cloud provider
* Resources reviewed
* Security tools used

### Step 2: Security Activities

Describe the activities you performed:

* Cloud environment exploration
* Security incident analysis
* Cloud log review
* Misconfiguration assessment

### Step 3: Findings

List the security issues you actually identified.

For each finding, include:

* Finding description
* Affected resource
* Supporting evidence
* Potential risk
* Recommended improvement

### Step 4: Recommendations

Suggest appropriate security improvements.

For example:

```text
- Apply least-privilege access.
- Review IAM permissions regularly.
- Restrict unnecessary public access.
- Configure network rules securely.
- Enable appropriate logging and monitoring.
- Investigate suspicious account activity.
```

### Step 5: Prepare the Report

Organize your findings into a clear report with an introduction, assessment details, findings, recommendations, and conclusion.

Keep the report simple, accurate, and based on the evidence you collected.

---

# Conclusion

By completing this hands-on task, you practiced five important cloud security activities:

```text
1. Explore cloud environments
2. Analyze cloud security incidents
3. Review cloud logs
4. Identify cloud misconfigurations
5. Create cloud security assessment reports
```

The purpose of this project is to understand how cloud security works in practice and learn how to identify potential security issues.

**The goal is to explore cloud resources, investigate evidence, identify risks, and document your findings clearly.**
